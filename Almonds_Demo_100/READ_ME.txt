Installation instructions:
  For ANY platform, you'll need to have any version of python3.10 installed from python.org.
  If you DON'T already have python3.10 installed, here are direct download links.

  Save yourself from navigating web pages and panicking on which version to choose
  by copying and pasting these links into your browser!

  For Windows:
      https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.9/python-3.10.9-amd64.exe
  For macOS:
      https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.9/python-3.10.9-macos11.pkg
  

  Double click on the .exe/.pkg file to go through the python installer.
  Now that you've downloaded and installed python3, you can install the game!


  For Windows, double click "windows_install.bat", you're ready to go!	
	
  For macOS:
		-Move the "Almonds_Demo" folder into the Downloads folder if it's not there already
		(the one that ONLY Says Almonds_Demo, without the numbers at the end)

		-Press "command" and spacebar at the same time
		-Type "Terminal" and press enter
		-Copy and paste this into the terminal:

		cd ~/Downloads/Almonds_Demo_100 && chmod +x *.sh && ./unix_install.sh

		-Then press enter, let it do its thing until text saying "Done!" appears in the terminal.
		-Close the terminal


Any time you wanna run Almonds, just double click "unix_START.sh" if you're on macOS/Linux
or "windows_START.bat" if you're on Windows.

### NOTE FOR macOS USERS: the colors look WAY better in iTerm2!) ###
